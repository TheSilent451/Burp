strings64.exe is a utility from the Sysinternals Suite, designed to extract readable strings from binary files. Here are some key points about it:

Purpose

Extract Strings: It identifies and extracts sequences of printable characters from binary files, which can include executables, libraries, and other types of data.
Data Analysis: Useful in reverse engineering, malware analysis, and debugging, allowing users to see text that may not be directly visible in binary format.

Features

64-bit Version: As indicated by the "64" in its name, itâ€™s optimized for 64-bit systems, making it faster and more efficient when working with larger files.
Customization: You can set parameters to specify the minimum string length to extract, which helps filter out noise.
Output Options: It can output the strings to the console or redirect them to a file for further analysis.

Usage

Navigate to the Directory
Use the cd command to navigate to the folder where strings64.exe is located. For example:
