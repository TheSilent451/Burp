1.strings64.exe

strings64.exe is a utility from the Sysinternals Suite, designed to extract readable strings from binary files. Here are some key points about it:

Purpose

\\ Extract Strings: It identifies and extracts sequences of printable characters from binary files, which can include executables, libraries, and other types of data.
\\ Data Analysis: Useful in reverse engineering, malware analysis, and debugging, allowing users to see text that may not be directly visible in binary format.

Features

\\ 64-bit Version: As indicated by the "64" in its name, it’s optimized for 64-bit systems, making it faster and more efficient when working with larger files.
\\ Customization: You can set parameters to specify the minimum string length to extract, which helps filter out noise.
\\ Output Options: It can output the strings to the console or redirect them to a file for further analysis.

Usage

Navigate to the Directory
Use the cd command to navigate to the folder where strings64.exe is located. For example:

cd C:\Path\To\Sysinternals

Run the Command
Use the command to extract strings from a binary file. For example:

strings64.exe C:\Path\To\YourFile.exe

Customize Options 
You can specify parameters like minimum string length. For example, to extract strings longer than 5 characters:

strings64.exe -n 5 C:\Path\To\YourFile.exe

Output to File
To save the output to a text file, use redirection:

strings64.exe C:\Path\To\YourFile.exe > output.txt

Example Command

strings64.exe -n 5 C:\Path\To\YourFile.exe > output.txt
This command will extract strings longer than 5 characters from YourFile.exe and save them to output.txt.

Applications

\\ Malware Analysis: Security researchers often use it to identify suspicious strings that might indicate malicious behavior.
\\ Debugging: Developers can use it to inspect binaries for error messages or other textual data that may assist in debugging.

\\ Assembly Inspection: It provides detailed views of assembly metadata, including types, methods, and resources.
\\ Search Functionality: You can search for specific classes, methods, or strings within assemblies.
\\ Plugins: ILSpy supports plugins, allowing for extended functionality tailored to specific needs.

Usage

\\ Download and Install: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ilspy.mirror/
\\ Open an Assembly: Launch ILSpy and drag-and-drop a .NET assembly (DLL or EXE) into the interface.
\\ Explore: Navigate through the tree structure to view namespaces, classes, methods, and properties.
\\ Decompile: Click on a method or class to view its decompiled source code.
\\ Export: You can export decompiled code as a project if needed.

Applications

\\ Reverse Engineering: Useful for understanding third-party libraries or applications when source code is not available.
\\ Debugging: Helps developers debug and analyze .NET applications.
\\ Security Analysis: Used in security research to inspect .NET malware or potentially harmful applications.
